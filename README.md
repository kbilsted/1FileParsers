# 1FileParsers
Various implementations of minimal parsers, each implemented in a single file.

The challenge is to create a parser in one file. 

The parser must support

* The gramar of the parser must be configurable, e.g. using the BNF-notation.
* The output of the parser must be structured, i.e. some for of an AST
* The more features the better
* The fewer lines the better
* Implementation language is your choice


Submissions are done using pull-requests with a folder prefixed with the implementation language followed by the name of your parser. Eg. "cs_miniparser" for "C#" and "miniparser"
